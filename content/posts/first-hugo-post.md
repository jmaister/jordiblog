After some time without writing the blog I decided to continue adding posts. Also becasue of the confinement due to the Coronavirus, I decided to renew my personal blog.

I am using Hugo because is the cool new way. Also because it is easy to install on any system. It only needs one executable or install a .deb package.

I was using Pelican and it is time to renew it, I didn't want to deal with the Python dependencies.
