I saw lots of blog posts, comments on blog posts, news, etc... about working remotely.

I want to write what I think about it so I can keep track of all needed and how to address every problem/benefit of working from home.

# Remote work

Since 2014 to the beginning of 2020, I've been working from home once or twice a day, this was revolutionary for me. Since I got 
my degree, I been working in an office, every day, and that was the only way I saw that work could be done.

In 2014, I moved to Ireland and started working in IBM. At first, I took working form home as a lazy way to skip the commute and
avoid the cold days of the Irish Winter or the rainy days (could be 350 of 365 days in Ireland :D). However, that sentiment changed
and I got WFH as a way to get more concentrated on my tasks.

Open plan offices are good for communicating with your team members, in formal meetings, quick visit to team mate desk, informal meeting with a coffee.
But, the great but, open plan offices are not good for concentration.

# 100% Remote work, mandatory

With the Covid Global Pandemic on March 2020, I started working 100% from home.
